Learned much about CSS through Trial and Error. Push constantly and be sure to double check the different parameters for each different sizing category. Still processing different numbers and what requires what, but I am happy to be learning!

Divs are super helpful to create certain classes, and then things can live inside of each div

constantly be thinking about how the setup will be and how to display it
