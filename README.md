Learned much about CSS through Trial and Error. Push constantly and be sure to double check the different parameters for each different sizing category. Still processing different numbers and what requires what, but I am happy to be learning!

Divs are super helpful to create certain classes, and then things can live inside of each div

constantly be thinking about how the setup will be and how to display it

Javascript
- Specific ID's and classes can relate to specific javascript code
- many instances of small errors which cause the entire thing to explode
- Promises are still a little hard to understand, do more research there
- JSON is also a little tricky, but starting to get the hang of it all. 
- Classes are fun and can be super helpful if you know how to use them correctly
- this is a pointer. Don't be intimidated, just run it back and it will make sense!
